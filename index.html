<p>Synthesijer is a high-level synthesis tool, which generates VHDL and Verilog HDL code from Java code. Synthesijer also provides a backend to generate VHDL/Verilog HDL, which helps to develop high-level synthesis tools and DSLs.</p>


<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<h3>Pre-Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java SE 8</li>
</ul>

<h3>Download Synthesijer</h3>
<!--
Download synthesijer-20150511.jar from here.
Synthesijer: 2.0.1

Usage: java [-cp classpath] synthesijer.Main [options] sources

Options:
  -h, --help: print this help
  --vhdl: output VHDL
  --verilog: output Verilog HDL
  (If you specify neither --vhdl nor --verilog, --vhdl is selected.)
  --config=file: thespecified file is used for compiler settings
  --no-optimize: do not apply any optimizations
  --chaining: do operation chaining in qreedy manner
  --operation-strength-reduction: do opeartion strength reduction
  --ip-exact=TOP: generates a IP package template for "TOP" module
  --vendor=name: to specify vendor id for generating a IP package
  --libname=name: to specify library name for generating a IP package

Please access to http://synthesijer.sorceforge.net/ for more information.
Writing 1st Program

This is a sample program to compile with Synthesijer.


public class Test{
  public boolean flag;
  private int count;

  public void run(){
    while(true){
      count++;
      if(count > 5000000){
	count = 0;
	flag = !flag;
      }
    }
  }
}

You can compile the sample code with Synthesijer as following:
java -cp synthesijer-20150511.jar synthesijer.Main Test.java
After compilation, "Test.vhd" should be generated. If you want to generate Verilog HDL code, please use --verilog option.
java -cp synthesijer-20150511.jar synthesijer.Main --verilog Test.java
Writing Top Module

You should write a top module to instantiate the generated module. The entity of the generated HDL module is the following code.

entity Test is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    reset : in std_logic;
    flag_out : out std_logic;
    flag_in : in std_logic;
    flag_we : in std_logic;
    run_req : in std_logic;
    run_busy : out std_logic
  );
end Test;
Unfortunately, top module cannot be written by pure Java program. You should use some annotations. The following code is a top module code for the above example.
import synthesijer.rt.*;

@synthesijerhdl
public class Top{
  private final Test test = new Test();

  @auto
  public boolean flag(){
    return test.flag;
  }

  @auto
  public void main(){
    test.run();
  }
}
To compile the example programs by the following command.
java -cp synthesijer-20150511.jar synthesijer.Main Test.java Top.java
You get four files "Test.vhd", "Top.vhd", "Test.v", and "Top.v" after the compilation. The generated files are synthesizable by existing tools, such as Xilinx ISE and QuartusII.
Writing Pin Assignment Configuration File

Generally, you have to write a configuration file for P&R tools (ex. "ucf", "xdc", or "qpf") to realize required mapping for your target board.
The generated entity for the above example top module(Top.vhd) is

entity Top is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    reset : in std_logic;
    flag_return : out std_logic
  );
end Top;
In this file, "flag_return" corresponds to the return value of "flag" method in Top.java. When you use Avnet Spartan-6 LX9 MicroBoard, the UCF file is as follow.
NET reset       LOC = V4  | IOSTANDARD = LVCMOS33 | PULLDOWN;    # "USER_RESET"
NET clk         LOC = C10 | IOSTANDARD = LVCMOS33;               # "CLOCK_Y3"
NET flag_return LOC = P4  | IOSTANDARD = LVCMOS18;               # "GPIO_LED1"
Synthesize, Place & Route, and Download

As usual.
Samples

You can see some samples that are available here. This archive includes such as
quickstart
the above example code
led
yet another sample of blinking led
sc1602
printing characters onto SC1602, which is a famous charactor display
serial_echo
echo input characters via serial port with capitalization
bf
an interpreter of brainf**k.
test
miscellaneous test codes.
You can build each of them with make command like the follwoing:
SYNTHESIJER=~/Downloads/synthesijer-20150511.jar make 
In samples, Synthesijer low-level HDL API is used to generate top module and timing dedicated modules. 
Some samples and your writing codes with array require HDL libraries. Those are included in synthesijer-applications-yyyymmdd.zip and synthesijer_lib_yyyymmdd.zip, which are also available here. If you use bash-available environment, setup-yyyymmdd.sh is useful to download and setup synthesijer environment.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
